# java-ngrok - a Java wrapper for ngrok

`java-ngrok` is a Java wrapper for `ngrok` that manages its own binary, making `ngrok` available via a
convenient Java API.

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is a reverse proxy tool that opens secure tunnels from public URLs to localhost, perfect
for exposing local web servers, building webhook integrations, enabling SSH access, testing chatbots, demoing from
your own machine, and more, and its made even more powerful with native Java integration through `java-ngrok`.

## Installation

`java-ngrok` is available on [Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.alexdlaird/java-ngrok/).

installed using `pip` to manage that for us.
